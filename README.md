Activity Week One
Hello all,
My name is Lauren and I am very excited (and a little bit scared!) for this class, as I have never had any exposure to coding before. I work in accounting at Sage Hospitality, a hotel management company, and live downtown with my husband, Nick, and cat named Princess Leia. I am currently working towards my MS in Accounting and enjoy running, yoga, rock climbing, and travlling in my spare time. I have been to over 50 countries so far and aim to one day visit them all!
